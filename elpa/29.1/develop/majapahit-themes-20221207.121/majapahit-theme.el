;;; Commentary:

;; The Majapahit theme, which comes in two variants, a dark and a light
;; one.
;;

;;; Note:

;; This package should be named `majapahit-themes' because it provides
;; more than one theme.  But upstream calls it `majapahit-theme' and
;; Melpa and Emacsmirror will continue to use that name as well, until
;; it is fixed upstream.

;; This file exists only so we can extract metadata from the (currently)
;; expected place.

;;; Code:

(provide 'majapahit-theme)

;;; majapahit-theme.el ends here
